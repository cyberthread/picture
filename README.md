# Picture Exercise
This exercise is a basic introduction to some of the skills needed to art direct imagery on your website. This exercise requires familiarity with both the image and picture elements in HTML and exporting images from photo editing software.

In this exercise you will:
- Export images for the web.
- Practice very basic default styling for images
- Use the picture element to "art direct" the images used across screen sizes

## Tasks
- Open the image included in the assets folder in your image editing software and create the following JPGs in RGB mode and save in the assets folder:
  -  An image called "hiking_square" that is 800px wide and at the 1:1 aspect ratio
  -  An image called "hiking_4_3" that is 1500px wide and at the 4:3 aspect ratio
  -  An image called "hiking_16_9" that is 2200px wide and at the 16:9 aspect ratio
-  Add an image element to the figure in the HTML file. Use the square image as the source. Be sure to include descriptive alt text that invites the viewer into the hiking narrative the image is meant to set up.
-  Add basic CSS rules for the image element so that the full image is always visible on screen. You'll need to set the display property and the width property to accomplish that.
-  Add the picture element to the HTML. 
  -  Use the 16:9 image for screens larger than 1500px (be sure to use rem value)
  - Use the 4:3 image for screens larger than 600px (be sure to use the rem value)
- Make live on the web
